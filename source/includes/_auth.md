# Authentication

<!-- > To authorize, use this code:


```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here" \
  -H "Authorization: MyAuthRandomKey"
``` -->

<!-- > Make sure to replace `MyAuthRandomKey` with your API key. -->

Ditio uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new API key at our [developer portal](https://ditio.no).

We expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

<!-- `Authorization: MyAuthRandomKey`

<!-- <aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>MyAuthRandomKey</code> with your personal API key.
